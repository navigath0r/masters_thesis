The waveforms obtained in each stage of the modelling process look plausible. They exhibit minimal ringing at the switching events without causing false turn on - turn off cycles. \\

The factory-provided model of the MOSFET supports thermal simulations. This was not used, the junction temperature was fixed at 25 \textcelsius. This corresponds to the datasheet conditions. \\

Ideal, linear components were used to populate the schematic. They are supposed to be good models at the operating conditions. \\

Using the ANSYS suite is rather cumbersome. We are not sure that the process we have found for extracting parasitics is the right way or the easiest way. Input from someone more acquainted with the program would be welcome. \\

In order to confirm the pertinence of the model, laboratory measurements should be performed on the real circuit. If they show closely matching results, investigating a more tightly integrated circuit is the next step.
