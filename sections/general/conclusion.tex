\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A model of a switching power pole was created in LTSpice. It was complemented by lumped inductances and capacitances extracted from critical parts of the PCB layout. Simulation results exhibit realistic-looking waveforms. The pertinence of the model has to be verified by lab measurements.
