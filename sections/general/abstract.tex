\section{Abstract}

As the level of integration rises in electronic assemblies, difficulties with measuring the voltage and current waveforms emerge. It might be impossible to attach probes to the circuit without heavily modifying its behaviour. A possible solution for these problems is making finite element simulations of the circuit and its printed circuit board layout. \\

The project goes through the development of a SPICE model for one leg of a switch-mode power converter. The model should reflect the parasitic components inherent to the layout to demonstrate their effects on crucial voltage and current waveforms. Different iterations of the modelling process are described. Besides SPICE simulation, the parasitic extraction process is covered in detail.
