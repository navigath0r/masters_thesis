\section{Theoretical background}
\label{sec:theory}

The theoretical background of the project is described in this section. Section \ref{sec:oscillators} deals with oscillator models for power MOSFET topologies. Section \ref{sec:circumstances_for_osc} explains the circumstances that enable oscillation. Section \ref{sec:ringing} briefly introduces ringing.
