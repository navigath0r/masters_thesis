\subsection{Overview}

At the beginning of the project, we got the schematic and layout of a single leg of a switch-mode power converter. The plan was to build a working LTSpice model of this using the manufacturer model of the MOSFET. Since it is just one leg and no load is attached in the original layout, it was complemented with a load resistor in a half-bridge inverter fashion. This mode of operation has the least deviation from the original layout while it remains easy to control. \\

Gradually extracting parasitics from the layout and adding them to the Spice model as linear, lumped components was the method ofhttps://www.overleaf.com/project/5dea5a6aca434e00011844e4 work. The goal was to get the characteristic parasitics, see their effects one by one, then arrive to a plausibly complex model that could later be verified by measurements.
