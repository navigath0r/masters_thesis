\subsubsection{Software}
\label{software_requirements}

Finding the right software suit proved somewhat difficult. ANSYS has several components that can cooperate and are integrated. The ones used were ANSYS Electronics Desktop and SIWave. Although the installer is not easily available, they all work with SDU's licence server. LTSpice is available for free. The Altium-files were provided as exported ODB++ and 3D PDF files, this way no Altium installation was required.

\subsubsection{Hardware}
\label{hardware_requirements}

Since this project is entirely about simulation, raw material costs are virtually null. Using a 3D mouse makes manipulating ANSYS incredibly easier but it is manageable without one. Individual simulation times with a mid-range laptop are tolerable.
